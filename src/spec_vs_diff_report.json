  "summary": "REQ-8 and REQ-9 appear implemented via adding a phone field to the resume data model and conditionally rendering phone, projects, contact links, and the Projects nav link based on content presence. REQ-7 is largely implemented (Fatima Chowdhury identity, email, location, education/experience entries, skills), but the diff does not provide evidence that the experience highlight bullet text was extracted from the uploaded resume screenshot rather than being newly authored.",

      "id": "REQ-7",
      "requirement": "Extract resume details from the uploaded screenshot and update frontend/src/resumeData.ts so education, experience (including bullet points as highlights), and skills match the screenshot (no invented content).",
      "reason": "While the correct employers/schools and basic fields are present, the experience `highlights` bullets shown are generic and the diff summary does not evidence they were taken from the screenshot; this may violate the requirement to extract (not invent) resume content.",
