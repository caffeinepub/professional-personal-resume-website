# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Center the Hero/Intro content like the “About Me” section and restore the “Hi, I’m …” greeting in the Hero headline.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the Hero/Intro section layout so the text block is horizontally centered and uses the same centered content width/alignment style as the “About Me” section on desktop and mobile.
- Adjust the Hero headline to explicitly include the greeting text `Hi, I'm {resumeData.name}` as the primary centered headline (wrapping naturally on small screens).
- Keep the “Computer Science” line and the “Get in Touch” / “Learn More” buttons present, centered, and stacked below the greeting headline, preserving their scroll-to-section behavior.

**User-visible outcome:** The homepage Hero content appears centered in the middle of the page (matching the “About Me” centered layout) and shows “Hi, I’m …” with the user’s name, with the subtitle and buttons centered beneath it.
