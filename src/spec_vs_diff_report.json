  "summary": "The diff shows the second span element in HeroSection h1 has been changed from gradient styling to solid accent color (text-accent class), which implements REQ-1. The modification is correctly scoped to only the second span element. However, the diff does not provide sufficient evidence to verify that the chosen color maintains good contrast against the background, as the actual color values are defined elsewhere (in CSS/Tailwind config).",
