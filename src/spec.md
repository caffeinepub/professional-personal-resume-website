# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Change the gradient name text in the hero section to a single solid color.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove gradient styling from the name text (second span in HeroSection h1)
- Apply a warm, solid color with good contrast against the background

**User-visible outcome:** The name text displays in a single solid color instead of a gradient, maintaining readability.
